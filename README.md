# Digit Recognizer Competition

## Competition
In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Weâ€™ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

# PROJECT CURRENTLY ON HOLD.
I'm in the process of learning more about CNN via Andrew Ng's deep learning courses! https://www.deeplearning.ai/

I'm assuming it should take roughly 3 weeks with my current schedule to complete. (Since I need to fly to Irvine for graduation and spend time with my girlfriend)
